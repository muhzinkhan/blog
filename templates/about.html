          I'm just a normal internet surfer🏄🏻‍♂️, just like you. Interested in web development 🕸️ and data science🖥️. 
          I constantly challenge myself to create things that are new to me✨. 
          I love memes🐸; they are my daily lifeline. The same goes with tech news🧑🏻‍💻. 
          They are what keep me going. All the more reason for me to share such memes and news with you guys, so you can have a blast, just like me.
